# Othello
> Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners.
> **William Shakespeare, Othello**

This project was created with create-react-app and inspired by my passion for board games, especially othello.

You can play the game [here](http://arthuranderson3@github.io/othello)

## Game options
* Play against the computer
* Computer versus computer

Have some fun and play against two computer opponents, Randy or Gollum. Try and guess how their choices are made :smiley:.
